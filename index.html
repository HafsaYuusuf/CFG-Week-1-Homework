     <h1>About me</h1>
     My name is Hafsa, I'm 20 years old and from West London. I turn 21 in September!  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26uNROFjLeQ2YeQuDn/giphy.gif" width="50" height="50" alt="21gif">

I finished my first year at university studying History and Philosophy. I've recently gone back to working full time over the summer - it has been hectic. Today is my first day off after working for 7 days straight!
Learning how to code is a new passion of mine that I've been enjoying a lot!
